		<h2>LSC 555<br>Liam O'Toole<br>Assignment #2</br>System Analysis and Usability Test</h2>
			<p1>I examined <a href="https://www.jstor.org/site/catholic-university/tower/?so=item_title_str_asc&searchkey=1763158375513">The Tower Archives</a> which contains a collection of 2,262 items, all microfilm scans of The Tower newspaper, from 1922 to 2020</p1>

	<h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>
	<p3>I was attempting to find historical articles related to armed conflict in the 20th and 21st centuries, from the perspective of an information professional advising a professor, while taking into account Nielsen's Ten Usability Heuristics</p3><br></br>
<p4>The layout of the website was clear and minimalist, and given the site had a search feature, I figured it would be easy to locate Tower articles related to major armed conflicts (World War 2, the Korean War, and the Vietnam war).<br></br> The search function was not very helpful, however, and didn't yield articles reflecting the Catholic University response to these armed conflicts. The text of older articles were not scanned, and so the search feature was not useful for finding articles related to historical events. The "date" sidebar item function was useful in tracking down issues coinciding with significant events, and this was the most useful method at locating articles about specific events related to armed conflicts. This was useful but more time consuming than a functional search feature would be. <br></br> In addition, the site was not user friendly when I selected the wrong date. It was unclear how to return to the home page.<br></br>The site did not have much flexibility or customizability; this was limited mainly to sorting by date, sequential order, or title by alphabetical order, A to Z. <br></br>Sidebar items other than "date" were not at all useful, as these are features of the host site, JSTOR and not customized to the needs of the Catholic University Tower Archives. Sorting by language is not a helpful feature when all articles are in English, for instance.<br></br>It actually took quite a bit longer than I expected to be able to find useful articles, which would frustrate a professor who would expect to find useful class materials quickly.

<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
<ol><li>Difficult to search text of articles as text itself is not scanned for older issues, i.e. difficult to do a keyword search for specific historical figure/event</li><li>Lack of clear "emergency exit" feature to return to homepage or previous page, hindering user control of system

	<h3>Conclusions based on heuristic analysis and mini usability test</h3>
<p4>After administering the mini-usability test, I noticed some similarities in using the Tower Archives page to find specific pieces of information. The experience of using the site is best described as frustrating and time consuming. There were some notable similarities in our respective attempts to locate information (myself as part of the heuristics test, the user as part of mini-usability test. Notably, in both cases, the task of tracking down articles on specific subjects (in this case, specific wars) took longer than the allotted time given. My colleague, in fact, was unable to track down two articles about both World War 2 and the Vietnam War during the time given, even when I had given him extra time as he wanted to retrieve the right information. In both cases, tracking down the correct articles was not intuitive and in fact required some trial and error; both of us had the same strategy of attempting to use the search function for specific keywords related to World War 2 and Vietnam, only to discover that the older scanned articles were not searchable. In both cases, we had to rely on the date feature. The user would have to know to use the “date” feature from the beginning, and this is useful for tracking down articles in issues related to specific events; users could pinpoint important dates and find issues after said dates (I was able to find the issue in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks through the date feature, for instance). 
	<br></br><br>There were some notable differences in the approach as well. The tasks that the user was engaged in for the mini-usability test were more directed and specific: he was given a task and asked to complete it in an allotted time. His reaction to the system was not based on foreknowledge of Nielsen’s Heuristics, but rather on ability (or inability) to complete the tasks; he became frustrated at his inability to find information. During the heuristics analysis, I was taking more of a critical eye towards the website, a macro view of the system and how well it satisfied external criteria (the heuristics). I was also less frustrated than the user as I was simply trying to evaluate the system and how well it worked. A user attempting to find something specific and hoping to be able to retrieve it quickly will be more keenly aware of its flaws in a direct way, and less open to troubleshooting. The user also had some difficulty in reading the text and had to use the zoom function. Overall, neither me nor the user in the mini usability test were impressed with the website and felt there was a lot of room for improvement. I would suggest, based on my heuristics analysis and administering the mini-usability test, that each issue be scanned and converted into plain text (.txt) format for access in addition to the microfilm scan, which would make the issues more accessible and make each article searchable. This would cut down the time it took to locate articles. I think it would also be helpful to sort individual articles and features into separate categories: news, sports, advice columns, etc… as well as into different events: Vietnam, World War 2, presidential elections. Lacking these features, the site hinders the ability of users to locate information quickly; given that users generally expect to find information very quickly, the Tower Archives feels rather useless and even obsolete in the digital environment today.</br>
